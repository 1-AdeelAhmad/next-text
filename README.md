# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Notes

- Implemented Task with Redux Toolkit - Reasons being it requires less boilerplate, a new refined version of Redux State Management for best practice. I was tempted for RTK Query for API calls but stayed with a more common approach.
- Implemented the Styling with TailwindCSS - I Took a component based approach for this task and refactored. I have experience with Styled Components and MUI. However due to time adopted a quicker styling option.
- No Middleware implemented, need to run it with cors disabled via browser extension
